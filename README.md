### Heeeey

Welcome welcome,

I'm one of those problem solver kids, although sometimes I also cause them. My obsessions change frequently because I like the challenge of doing something completely out of my comfort zone.

Summary of me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with React Native (Kotlin, Swift and the occassional Expo), Unity, Blender and a lot of Node.JS.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust and a dash of c++ with Unreal
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything. Get in touch! I want to know more about you.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, too. I love helping out.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: wesley@spoonx.studio
- âš¡ Fun fact: this used to brag about my height but I've grown since then.
